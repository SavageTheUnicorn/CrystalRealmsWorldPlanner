This is the source code for the Crystal Realms World Planner!

It's in a W.I.P state!

It's built using python and can be built into a standalone executable using the build_executable.py script.

Please review any/all code before running it on your own machine!

I don't really plan on adding changelogs etc, I'm lazy.

This repo is mostly to allow public PR's for improvements! (Whether or not I can/will integrate them is a different question!)

Thanks for visiting!~

(The latest version of the executable built by myself will always be available here)
